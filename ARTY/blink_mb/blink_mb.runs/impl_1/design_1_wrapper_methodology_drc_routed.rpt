There is a large setup violation of -6.630 ns between design_1_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/Operand_Select_I/EX_Op2_reg[29]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0_1) and design_1_i/microblaze_0/U0/MicroBlaze_Core_I/Performance.Core/Data_Flow_I/Operand_Select_I/EX_Branch_CMP_Op1_reg[9]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

XDCC-2#1 Warning
Scoped Non-Timing constraint/property overwritten  
A new XDC property IOSTANDARD on CLK overrides a previous scoped property. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) property and could result in unexpected behaviours.
